🌍 EcoSystem Simulator

EcoSystem Simulator is a Java project designed to model species, habitats, and their interactions. The goal is to demonstrate Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Generics, and Clean Software Architecture by building a modular and extensible simulation engine.

This project is more than a toy simulation — it’s structured like a resume-ready software project that can be extended into a real application with a web frontend and backend services.

✨ Features

Species modeling using abstract classes, generics, and traits (PhysicalTraits, TechnicalTraits, etc.)

Habitats such as Forests, Oceans, and Deserts

Simulation Engine that can initialize species and simulate interactions

Configurable initialization (species selection, traits, habitat)

Clean package structure for scalability

Extensible design to support new species, behaviors, and environments

🚀 Getting Started

Prerequisites

Java 17+ (recommended)

Maven or Gradle (for build & dependency management)


Running the Project

# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/Tushar-sketch-bit/EcoSystem.git

# Navigate into project
cd EcoSystem

# Compile and run
javac Main.java
java Main

🧩 Extending the Project

You can easily add new species or habitats by following the structure:

1. Create a new class in the species/ package, e.g. Elephant.java

Extend Species<MammalTraits>

Define unique physical/technical traits



2. Add habitat support in environment/ if needed.


3. Plug into the simulation engine via the initializer (dynamic creation planned using enums or reflection).

🔮 Future Roadmap

🌐 Frontend: React.js dashboard to visualize the ecosystem (species population, traits, interactions)

⚙️ Backend: Spring Boot REST APIs to run simulations, manage species data, and persist states

🎮 Game-like Mode: Allow users to "play" with ecosystems — add/remove species and watch changes

📊 Data Export: Export simulation logs to CSV/JSON for analysis
